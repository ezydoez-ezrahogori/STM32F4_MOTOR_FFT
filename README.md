# STM32F4_MOTOR_FFT
Project Overview: Motor Signal Analysis Using FFT on STM32F411RE This project aims to analyze the frequency components of motor signals using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm implemented in bare metal programming on the STM32F411RE microcontroller. By converting time-domain signals into frequency-domain data
